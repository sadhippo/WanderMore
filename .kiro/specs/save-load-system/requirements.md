# Save and Load System Requirements Document

## Introduction

The save and load system will provide comprehensive offline-only persistence for the Monogame auto-explorer project. The system will save and restore the complete game state including the adventurer's position and status, journal entries and statistics, discovered Points of Interest, and provide an extensible architecture for the upcoming quest system and future game systems. The system will be designed for single-player gameplay with multiple save slots and automatic backup functionality.

3. WHEN the game saves THEN the system SHALL persist current zone information and transitions
4. WHEN the game saves THEN the system SHALL persist world generation seeds and parameters
5. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL restore environmental conditions accurately
6. WHEN world state is restored THEN the system SHALL maintain temporal consistency and progression

### Requirement 6: Extensible Save Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a save system that can easily accommodate new game systems, so that future features integrate seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new systems are added THEN the save system SHALL support registration of new save components
2. WHEN save data format changes THEN the system SHALL handle version migration automatically
3. WHEN systems implement ISaveable interface THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in saves
4. WHEN quest system is implemented THEN the system SHALL seamlessly integrate quest state persistence
5. WHEN future systems are added THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing saves
6. WHEN save components fail THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and continue with other components

### Requirement 7: Multiple Save Slots

**User Story:** As a player, I want multiple save slots, so that I can maintain different adventure playthroughs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new game THEN the system SHALL allow me to select an available save slot
2. WHEN I load a game THEN the system SHALL display all available save slots with metadata
3. WHEN I save to a slot THEN the system SHALL update the slot's timestamp and preview information
4. WHEN save slots are full THEN the system SHALL allow me to overwrite existing saves with confirmation
5. WHEN I delete a save slot THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data and backups
6. WHEN save slot metadata is displayed THEN the system SHALL show play time, progress, and last save date

### Requirement 8: Automatic Backup System

**User Story:** As a player, I want automatic backups of my save files, so that I'm protected against data corruption or accidental loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a save operation completes THEN the system SHALL create a backup of the previous save
2. WHEN multiple backups exist THEN the system SHALL maintain a configurable number of backup copies
3. WHEN save corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically restore from the most recent valid backup
4. WHEN backup restoration occurs THEN the system SHALL notify the player of the recovery action
5. WHEN backup files accumulate THEN the system SHALL clean up old backups based on age and count limits
6. WHEN backup operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors but continue normal save operations

### Requirement 9: Save File Security and Integrity
