# Adventurer Pathfinding System Requirements

## Introduction

The adventurer pathfinding system will enhance the current wandering behavior with lightweight pathfinding capabilities. The adventurer will continue to explore naturally and randomly, but when a Point of Interest comes within detection range, the system will enable intelligent navigation to reach it while avoiding obstacles. This creates an organic exploration experience where discovery feels natural rather than overly goal-driven.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lightweight Pathfinding to PoIs

**User Story:** As a player, I want the adventurer to naturally wander until they notice something interesting nearby, then intelligently navigate to it, so that exploration feels organic and discovery-driven.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the adventurer is wandering normally THEN the system SHALL maintain the current random movement behavior
2. WHEN a PoI comes within detection range (approximately 5-7 tiles) THEN the system SHALL switch to pathfinding mode to reach it
3. WHEN pathfinding to a PoI THEN the system SHALL calculate a simple path around basic obstacles
4. WHEN the adventurer reaches the target PoI THEN the system SHALL initiate interaction and return to wandering mode afterward
5. WHEN pathfinding fails or takes too long THEN the system SHALL abandon the target and return to wandering

### Requirement 2: Simple Obstacle Avoidance

**User Story:** As a player, I want the adventurer to smoothly navigate around obstacles when heading to a PoI, so that they don't get stuck or behave unnaturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pathfinding encounters impassable terrain (water, stone) THEN the system SHALL find a simple route around it
2. WHEN pathfinding encounters buildings THEN the system SHALL navigate around them using basic obstacle avoidance
3. WHEN the adventurer gets stuck during pathfinding THEN the system SHALL detect this and try alternative approaches
4. WHEN obstacles make a PoI unreachable THEN the system SHALL abandon the target after a reasonable attempt
5. WHEN pathfinding around obstacles THEN the system SHALL use simple, efficient algorithms rather than complex A* implementations

### Requirement 3: PoI Detection and Prioritization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the adventurer to notice interesting things nearby during their wandering, so that exploration leads to natural discoveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the adventurer is wandering THEN the system SHALL periodically check for PoIs within detection range
2. WHEN multiple PoIs are within range THEN the system SHALL choose the closest or most interesting one
3. WHEN the adventurer has recently interacted with a PoI THEN the system SHALL apply a cooldown before targeting it again
4. WHEN a PoI is no longer reachable or interesting THEN the system SHALL abandon it and return to wandering
5. WHEN no PoIs are in range THEN the system SHALL continue normal wandering behavior

### Requirement 4: Seamless Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pathfinding system to enhance rather than replace the current wandering behavior, so that the adventurer feels more intelligent without losing the organic exploration feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no PoIs are in range THEN the system SHALL use the existing random movement and collision handling
2. WHEN pathfinding is active THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing animation and interaction systems
3. WHEN pathfinding completes or fails THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition back to normal wandering
4. WHEN zone transitions occur THEN the system SHALL work with existing zone management without conflicts
5. WHEN the pathfinding system is disabled THEN the game SHALL function exactly as it currently does
