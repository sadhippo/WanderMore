# Quest System Requirements Document

## Introduction

The quest system will transform the existing Points of Interest (PoIs) into a comprehensive quest-giving and completion experience. The system will integrate with existing weather, seasonal, biome, and character systems to create dynamic, contextual quests that enhance exploration and provide meaningful objectives for players. Quests will be given by NPCs and characters found at PoIs, with completion conditions tied to environmental observations and interactions with the game world.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Quest Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want quest data stored in JSON format, so that quests can be easily configured, modified, and expanded without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN the system SHALL load quest definitions from JSON files
2. WHEN quest data is modified in JSON files THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without requiring game restart
3. WHEN quest data contains invalid format THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with valid quests
4. WHEN quest data includes conditions THEN the system SHALL support weather, biome, seasonal, and PoI-based conditions
5. WHEN quest data includes rewards THEN the system SHALL support experience, items, and journal entries as rewards

### Requirement 2: Quest Giver Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want NPCs and characters at PoIs to give me quests, so that I have meaningful interactions with the world's inhabitants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I approach an NPC PoI THEN the system SHALL display quest availability indicators
2. WHEN I interact with a quest-giving NPC THEN the system SHALL present available quests based on my progress
3. WHEN an NPC has no available quests THEN the system SHALL display appropriate dialogue
4. WHEN I accept a quest THEN the system SHALL add it to my active quest log
5. WHEN I complete a quest THEN the NPC SHALL acknowledge completion and provide rewards
6. WHEN quest conditions are met THEN the system SHALL automatically detect completion

### Requirement 3: Environmental Quest Conditions

**User Story:** As a player, I want quest objectives tied to environmental observations, so that exploration and weather watching become meaningful gameplay activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quest requires weather observation THEN the system SHALL track current weather conditions in specific biomes
2. WHEN a quest requires seasonal events THEN the system SHALL monitor seasonal changes and time-based conditions
3. WHEN a quest requires biome exploration THEN the system SHALL track player presence in specific zone types
4. WHEN a quest requires animal spotting THEN the system SHALL detect proximity to specific animal PoIs
5. WHEN environmental conditions are met THEN the system SHALL update quest progress automatically
6. WHEN multiple conditions exist THEN the system SHALL support AND/OR logic combinations

### Requirement 4: Quest Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a player, I want to track my quest progress, so that I know what objectives I need to complete and my current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have active quests THEN the system SHALL display them in a quest log interface
2. WHEN quest progress changes THEN the system SHALL update progress indicators in real-time
3. WHEN I complete quest objectives THEN the system SHALL provide visual and audio feedback
4. WHEN I complete all objectives THEN the system SHALL mark the quest as ready for turn-in
5. WHEN I view quest details THEN the system SHALL show objective descriptions and current progress
6. WHEN quests have time limits THEN the system SHALL display remaining time

### Requirement 5: Quest Chain and Dependency System

**User Story:** As a player, I want quests that build upon each other, so that I experience a sense of progression and narrative continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quest has prerequisites THEN the system SHALL only make it available after prerequisites are completed
2. WHEN I complete a quest THEN the system SHALL unlock any dependent quests
3. WHEN quest chains exist THEN the system SHALL maintain narrative continuity between related quests
4. WHEN I abandon a quest THEN the system SHALL handle dependencies appropriately
5. WHEN quest chains span multiple NPCs THEN the system SHALL coordinate between quest givers

### Requirement 6: Dynamic Quest Generation

**User Story:** As a player, I want quests that adapt to my current location and game state, so that quest content feels relevant and contextual.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm in a specific biome THEN the system SHALL prioritize quests relevant to that environment
2. WHEN seasonal conditions change THEN the system SHALL generate season-appropriate quests
3. WHEN I've completed certain quest types THEN the system SHALL offer more advanced variations
4. WHEN I discover new PoIs THEN the system SHALL potentially generate quests related to those locations
5. WHEN weather patterns occur THEN the system SHALL create weather-specific quest opportunities

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the quest system to seamlessly integrate with existing game systems, so that it enhances rather than disrupts current gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quests are active THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing journal system for notifications
2. WHEN quest conditions involve weather THEN the system SHALL use the existing WeatherManager
3. WHEN quest conditions involve biomes THEN the system SHALL use the existing ZoneManager
4. WHEN quest conditions involve PoIs THEN the system SHALL use the existing PoIManager events
5. WHEN quest rewards are given THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing progression systems
6. WHEN the adventurer NPC completes activities THEN the system SHALL potentially trigger quest-related events

### Requirement 8: Quest Persistence and Save System

**User Story:** As a player, I want my quest progress to be saved, so that I can continue my quests across game sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save the game THEN the system SHALL persist all active quest states
2. WHEN I load the game THEN the system SHALL restore quest progress accurately
3. WHEN quest conditions were met while offline THEN the system SHALL handle state reconciliation appropriately
4. WHEN quest data changes between sessions THEN the system SHALL handle version compatibility
5. WHEN save data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors without breaking gameplay

### Requirement 9: Quest Reward System

**User Story:** As a player, I want meaningful rewards for completing quests, so that I feel motivated to engage with the quest system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a quest THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate rewards based on quest difficulty
2. WHEN rewards include items THEN the system SHALL add them to my inventory
3. WHEN rewards include experience THEN the system SHALL update my character progression
