# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a simple stats system for the adventurer that tracks experience, hunger, tiredness, comfort level, and mood. The system is designed to be non-punishing and maintain the relaxing flow of the game while adding depth. Comfort is derived from hunger and tiredness levels, and mood is influenced by comfort and weather. A simple HUD with stat bars provides at-a-glance monitoring, with an optional detailed stats page.

3. WHEN displaying the stats page THEN it SHALL use the same visual style as existing UI
