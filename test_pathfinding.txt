Pathfinding Integration Test Results:

1. P Key Test: Press P in game to see pathfinding status
2. Ranger Interaction Test: Watch adventurer approach and interact with ranger
3. Console Output: Check for debug messages

Expected Behaviors:
- Adventurer should detect nearby PoIs within 320 pixels (10 tiles)
- Adventurer should pathfind toward interesting PoIs (Rangers, NPCs, buildings)
- Adventurer should interact with PoIs when close enough
- Quest system should give quests from NPCs like Rangers
- P key should show pathfinding status in console

If these don't work, there may be integration issues.
